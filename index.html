                   <h3>1. Jacksonville Jaguars</h3>
                   <h4><em>Trevor Lawrence- QB, Clemson</em></h4>
                   <p>Jacksonville has already done a lot in free agency to make them competetive 
                       this upcoming season. But with the first pick ine the 2021 NFL draft, it has 
                       been quite apparent for a while who they are taking. Lawrence has been the 
                       overwhelming favorite to be the first pick for several years now, and it was 
                       more of a question of who was going to suck to get him. The answer turned out 
                       to be the Jaguars. And with some lean years seemling since the Franchise 
                       started, Jaguar fans now have a franshise QB that they can call theirs for 
                       years to come.</p>

                   <a name= "New York J"></a>
                   <h3>2. New York Jets</h3>
                   <h4><em>Zach Wilson- QB, BYU</em></h4>
                   <p>This pick has been a litte more controverseal with QB being the concensis 
                       position, but which player being more of the question. Zach Wilson has 
                       emerged as the favorite to go second overall. With his electric style of 
                       play and big play potential people have fallen in love with Wilson. There 
                       have even been comparisons to Patrick Mahomes in regards to keeping plays 
                       alive and the threat of scoring on any play.This does mean they will have 
                       to figure out what they are doing with Sam Darnold, but that can be done 
                       at the draft or before to aquire more draft capitol. If they are going 
                       surprise to ride with Darnold, it would be no surprise if they took their 
                       pick of the offensive lineman her at number 2, or traded down to add more 
                       first round picks as they continue to rebuild</p>

                   <a name= "Miami"></a>
                   <h3> 3. Miami Dolphins</h3>
                   <h4><em>Ja'Marr Chase- WR, LSU</em></h4>
                   <p>The Dolphins have a huge choise with their current QB Tua and whether or not 
                       he is the future. If they deside to keep him as the long term solution, Chase 
                       will add a playmaker on the outside that they desperetly need. They have a good 
                       wide recieving core, but no one that scares you. This would give the offesne 
                       another dimension and give Tua another weapon to help his growth. Even if the 
                       rumors are true and they do land Deshawn Watson, they need a playmaker for him 
                       to throw to. There is a big chance they draft one of the top quarterback 
                       availabel, or draft one of the top offensive lineman with the number three 
                       overall pick as well. But they have spent the last couple of years trying to 
                       retool the offensive line, and I think they can address that with a later pick. </p>

                   <a name= "Atlanta"></a>
                   <h3>4. Atlanta Falcons</h3>
                   <h4><em>Justin Fields- QB, Ohio State</em></h4>
                   <p>This will also be a simple pick for the Falcons I believe. They will take their 
                       choice of the quarterbacks left. If the Jets decide to go with Darnold and go 
                       away from Zach Wilson, and no one jumps up to take him, the Falcons may still 
                       go with the bigger athlete in Justin Fields or Trey Lance. These two are more 
                       of a project, but they are looking for someone to learn under Matt Ryan for a 
                       season or two.</p>

                <a name= "Cincinnati"></a>
                <h3>5. Cincinnati Bengals</h3>
                <h4><em>Penei Sewell- OT, Oregon</em></h4>
                <p>Offensive Tackle is never a sexy pick, but I think that every single Bengals fan will 
                    admit that they need to protect their 2020 first round pick Joe Burrow. Burrow made 
                    the most of his time at quarterback for the Bengals before his season ending knee 
                    injury. It seemed on every play that Burrow was running for his life or getting hit 
                    in the backfield. Sewell is one of the best offensive tackle prospects in a while, 
                    and Cincinnati would be stupid for not taking him with the fith pick (if he is there). 
                    There are some other great prospects at the tackle position that if Sewell is not 
                    there, they can easily pivot to, but Sewell would definitely be the apple of the 
                    Bengles eye.</p>

                <h3>6. Philadelphia Eagles</h3>
                <h4><em>Kyle Pitts- TE, Florida</em></h4>
                <p>Pitts come in as easily the best TE poroscpect in this draft, but also arguably the 
                    top pass catching target of this draft class. Zach Ertz made a great career in 
                    Philadelphia, and got his ring, but the Eagles are not expected to bring him back 
                    this year and their other tight end in Dallas Goedert being a free agent after this 
                    season, they will need to reload at this position. The Eagles are also just revamping 
                    their entire pass catching core, and Pitts will be a great building block for young 
                    quarterback Jalen Hurts. Do not be surprised if they do look wide reciever here as 
                    well.</p>

                <h3>7. Detroit Lions</h3>
                <h4><em>Jaylen Waddle- WR, Alabama</em></h4>
                <p>Detroit made their move in trading away their best quarterback in franchise history in 
                    Matthew Stafford this offseason, signifying they might be taking a step back and 
                    developing a new core. This was also seen with thier decision in not franchise tagging 
                    Kenny Galladay, and letting him walk. They also lost Marvin Jones in free agency. The 
                    Lions I would think are looking to retool and get yonger on the edge and give their new 
                    quarterback Jarred Goff a playmaker.</p>

                <a name= "Carolina"></a>
                <h3>8. Carolina Panthers</h3>
                <h4><em>Trey Lance- QB, North Dekota State</em></h4>
                <p>The Panthers have been in on just about any quarterback that has been rumored wanting 
                    out of their current team, or teams possibly moving on. If they do not land one of 
                    the top names on that POTENTIAL trade black. They will most likely draft the Teddy 
                    Bridgewater's heir apparent. They have been heavily in scouting all the top 
                    quarterbacks of this draft and it would be a big surprise if they tried trading up to 
                    get thir quarterback that they want the most. They have been heavily linked to Trey 
                    Lance, despite only being a one year starter and starting the Bison's only game this 
                    year. He is a big time prospect but still pretty raw. I think a perfect candidate to 
                    learn under a great mentor quarterback like Bridgewater.</p>

                <a name= "Denver"></a>
                <h3>9. Denver Broncos</h3>
                <h4><em>Micah Parsons- LB, Penn State</em></h4>
                <p>The Broncos can go in so many directions, and it all starts with thier quarterback, 
                    Drew Lock. They have at times come out as saying they think he is a franchise 
                    quarterback, and otheres offered him as trade bait to land a top quarterback on the 
                    POTENTIAL market. I have them taking one of the most athletic linbackers that in 
                    this draft in Parsons. He would dramatically help this defense that is already pretty 
                    solid. With the signing of Fuller, their cornerback position has a better feel to it, 
                    so I think a corner this high for them is not the best option, but a trade down may 
                    also be in play as well. But Parson will be a great linebacker for them or whoever is 
                    able to get him.</p>

                <a name= "Dallas"></a>
                <h3>10. Dallas Cowboys</h3>
                <h4><em>Rashawn Slater- OT, Northwestern</em></h4>
                <p>I think the Cowboys missed out on solitifying the future of the offensive line last year, 
                    when they took CeeDee Lamb at wide reciever instead. And it is no guarantee that Jerry 
                    Jones will not look to make another splash pick with their top 10 pick. But they SHOULD 
                    look to bolster their offensive line to protect their newley high paid quarterback in Dak 
                    Prescott, who is coming off a year where he broke his ankle early in the year. Again 
                    offensive line may not be a sexy pick but Slater is a solid pick and could be a cornerstone 
                    of their line for years to come. Jerry should swallow his pride and go ahead and do the 
                    sensible thing and draft a lineman and get back to the best offensive line in football.</p>
